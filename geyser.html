                Our main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means “Big splash” and erupts up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu is semi-predictable, as she plays 15-20 minutes after another of our active geysers. According to Maori culture, geysers are viewed as gifts from the gods
                To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is the “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser – named after Prince Edward Albert visited here in the 1900’s. It was traditionally named the “Tohu” or sign as it usually plays 10 mins before and then simultaneously with Pohutu and reaches heights of up to seven metres (almost 23 feet). While the water is under significant pressure causing the boiling point to be well over 125 degrees Celsius.
                As pockets of water become turbulent, the pressure is relieved by violently shooting steam and water into the air with tremendous force.

                At Te Puia we got to experience a vast range of Geyers like Pohutu the main Geyser they have. We also got to see lots of other Geysers like the prince of the wale
                featers and the Kererū Geyser. For centuries, Māori have recognised and sourced geothermal energy for various
                purposes. They consider these areas as sources of healing, sustenance, and power and traditionally use thermal fluid for bathing and treating various ailments.
                Additionally, geothermal resources played a vital role in traditional Māori cooking practices. Steam vents, hot springs and heated soils were used for cooking, particularly for the preparation of "hangi" meals. A hangi involves cooking food in an earth oven, using the geothermal steam to heat and add unique flavors to the meal. All geysers have three components; an intensive heat source, a constant supply of water and an underground plumbing system.
                As rainfall fills the intricate plumbing system below the earth's surface, molten rock rapidly heats the water.

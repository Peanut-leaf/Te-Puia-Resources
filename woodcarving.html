        <div class="wood-text2"><p>At the national carving school we saw where they keep their wood. In the garage of wood there was a big chunk from a tree. We learnt that with this wood, Te Puia students make traditional Māori carvings; beautiful handcrafted pieces made at tehir National Carving School. In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School began the task of learning the disciplines of their Māori ancestors. Among those students was Clive Fugill, the man who would become master carver of the institute today.</p> </div>

            “I’ll never forget that first day,” says Clive, “Our master carver, Hone Taiapa, looked at us all and said, “you are here to learn the art to pass it on to generations. Keep it alive for we could lose our identity.” It was exciting to be playing such an important role to save Māori art,” says Clive, “everyone has a reason in life. This was my reason. And that’s why I’m still here over 40 years later. If we lose our arts and crafts we lose our identity.”

        <div class="wood-text"> <p>This was one of the carvings for sale at Te Puia's gift shop. Today fulltime carving students study for three years at the national carving school, under the guidance of those, such as Clive Fugill and James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia who were once institute carving students themselves.
            The protruding tongue, as used in the haka (war dance), is intended as a symbol of defiance, determination and strength, however in many carvings it can also symbolize the oral nature in which information was passed on from generation to generation.

            <h1>Geysers</h1>
            <p>At Te Puia we got to experience a vast range of Geyers like Pohutu the main Geyser they have. We also got to see lots of other Geysers like the prince of the wale featers and the Kererū Geyser. For centuries, Māori have recognised and sourced geothermal energy for various
                purposes. They consider these areas as sources of healing, sustenance, and power and traditionally use thermal fluid for bathing and treating various ailments.
                Additionally, geothermal resources played a vital role in traditional Māori cooking practices. Steam vents, hot springs and heated soils were used for cooking, particularly for the preparation of "hangi" meals. A hangi involves cooking food in an earth oven, using the geothermal steam to heat and add unique flavors to the meal.</p>
            <h1>How do Geysers work?</h1>
            <p>
                All geysers have three components; an intensive heat source, a constant supply of water and an underground plumbing system.
                As rainfall fills the intricate plumbing system below the earth's surface, molten rock rapidly heats the water.
                The water is under significant pressure causing the boiling point to be well over 125 degrees Celsius.
                As pockets of water become turbulent, the pressure is relieved by violently shooting steam and water into the air with tremendous force.

            <h1>Wood Carvings</h1>
            <p>
                At Te Puia we got to see their national Māori carving school. In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School began the task of learning the disciplines of their Māori ancestors. Among those students was Clive Fugill, the man who would become master carver of the institute today. Today fulltime carving students study for three years at the national carving school, under the guidance of those, such as Clive Fugill and James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia who were once institute carving students themselves.
            </p>
            <h1>What do they make?</h1>
            <p>At Te Puia we saw students working on wooden hand clubs. We also learnt that before Europeans and European weapons arrived in Aotearoa, Māori warfare mainly involved hand-to-hand combat. Warriors used many different hand weapons, including taiaha (fighting staffs), pouwhenua (pointed staffs), tewhatewha (axe-like staffs), tao (short spears), huata (long spears) and patu (clubs). The long weapons were carried, and the small clubs were often tucked into a belt. Special weapons were sometimes given names and passed down through generations.</p>

            <h1>Mud Pools</h1>
            <p>At Te puia we also got to see their range of mud pools which were very close to the Geysers. The mud pool is the result of acid gases and steam that cause the
                decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form a clay called kaolin. Kaolin is white when pure, but finely divided black sulphur turns it to grey.
                The activity varies with the amount of rainfall.
                </p>
            <h1>How do Mud Pools work?</h1>
            <p>
                forms where steam and gas rise to the surface under ponds of rain water. The acidic gases turn surrounding rock into clay which mixes with water to produce a muddy, steam-heated slurry, or mud pool. The temperature of the steaming bursts of mud is approximately 90-95 degrees Celsius (194-203 degrees Fahrenheit).
